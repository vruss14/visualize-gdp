# USA GDP Visualization

## Overview

A visualized representation of the United States GDP. Built with D3.js.

## Description

This project is my first experience working with the D3.js library. Working with D3 is a lot different from other projects that I have created, so creating a bar chart from a JSON file was a great learning experience for me. One of the main things that I learned is that it is important to think about creating a graph conceptually first, and then write the code that will achieve what you are trying to do. I initially focused on scaling the graph using a specific value, but then realized it made more sense to think about it in terms of width, height, padding, and the total amount of data values provided in the file (dataset.length). This made it easier to create a graph where the bars matched up with the x and y axes exactly.

Another concept that I learned in making this project with D3.js was using scaleTime. In previous exercises, I had only worked with scaleLinear but needed to figure out a way to accurately represent data in years on the x axis. Using scaleTime was helpful because it gave me the opportunity to create a JavaScript Date object for each data point.

Overall, this was a very helpful experience to practice creating something in D3.js from scratch. It was a difficult project for me to create, but ultimately my understanding of D3.js grew immensely because of creating it.
